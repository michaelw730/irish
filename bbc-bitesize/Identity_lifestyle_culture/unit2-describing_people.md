# Describing People

To describe a person’s characteristics, we use the copula structure in Irish.

This means that we use the 
noun
 and then the 
adjective
.

For example, a tall man is translated as fear ard.

----

Cén sórt duine tú / é / í? - What type of person are you / he / she?

I am a friendly person.	Is duine cairdiúil mé.
He is a funny person.	Is duine greannmhar é.
She is a clever girl.	Is cailín cliste í.
'Sorcha is a quiet person' would be 'Is duine ciúin í Sorcha'.


To put these types of descriptions into the negative form, change ‘Is’ to ‘Ní’.

To put these types of descriptions into the question form, change ‘Is’ to ‘An’.

I am a friendly person.	Is duine cairdiúil mé.
I am not a friendly person.	Ní duine cairdiúil mé.
Am I a friendly person?	An duine cairdiúil mé?


The 
subjects
 used with the copula in Irish include:

mé	I
tú	you
é	he
í	she
muid	we
sibh	you (plural)
iad	they



Déan cur síos fisiciúil ar _________.	Physically describe _________.
Caitheann sé / sí spéaclaí.	He / she wears glasses.
Tá bricíní air / uirthi.	He / she has freckles.
Tá féasóg / croiméal ar mo dhaidí.	My dad has a beard / moustache.
cosúil le	like
san aghaidh	in looks
sa phearsantacht	in personality




Sílim gur duine cairdiúil tú. - I think that you are a friendly person.

Sílim gur duine ionraic é. - I think that he is an honest person.

Here is some useful vocabulary:

grámhar	loving / affectionate
tuisceanach	understanding
beomhar	full of life / lively
múinte	mannerly
ionraic / macánta	honest
dílis	loyal
sona	happy / joyful
millte	spoiled
dímhúinte	rude / unmannerly
éadmhar	jealous
dalba	mischievous / naughty



Grammar

Adjectives
 must agree with nouns. This means:

a masculine 
noun
 does not affect the spelling of the adjective which follows
a feminine noun causes an 
aspiration
 / séimhiú to the adjective which follows
m = masculine noun

f = feminine noun

Examples

fuinneog mhór has an aspiration / séimhiú because fuinneog is feminine (f)

tábla mór has not got an aspiration / séimhiú because tábla is masculine (m)
