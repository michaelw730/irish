Irish = verb-subject-object
English = subject-verb-object

The dog ate the food
D’ith an madra an bia

adjectives follow the nouns they modify
The man is tall and handsome
Tá an fear ard dáthúil (literally “Is the man tall handsome”).


If someone asks you a question that would normally be answered with “yes” or “no,” you reply by restating the verb used to ask the question in either its positive or negative form

Ar ith an madra an bia? Did the dog eat the food?

You would answer:

D’ith: Yes (literally “ate”)

or…

Níor ith: No (literally “didn’t eat”)


Gender Identity
As with most European languages, all nouns in Irish are either grammatically masculine or grammatically feminine.

We say “grammatically” masculine or feminine because grammatical gender doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with actual sex. For example, the Irish word cailín (girl) is grammatically masculine, and the Irish word stáil (stallion) is grammatically feminine.


To Be Or Not To Be
One very significant way in which Irish varies from English is that it has two different ways of expressing the verb “to be,” and they’re not interchangeable.

One way, using the verb bí (present tense tá) is used when you’re speaking of something or someone’s state or condition, describing its appearance, or talking about what it’s doing:

Tá an madra ag ithe: The dog is eating.

Tá an madra beag: The dog is little.

The other, using the funny little semi-verb is (known in grammatical terms as the copula) is used when you’re talking about what something or someone is as opposed to what it is like or what it is doing:

Is madra beag é sin: That is a little dog.
