# The family part 1


AN TEAGHLACH 1 | THE FAMILY 1

The Irish equivalents of word like 'my' and 'your' that denote possession affect words in different ways.
Mo and the other words that denote possession are never stressed in everyday speech. You add certain endings in order to add emphasis ..sa

The nouns following the personal numbers are usually in the genitive plural (although some of the nouns look exactly as they do in the nominative singular).  One last thing to remember: words beginning with a consonant take a séimhiú after beirt.

This rule doesn't apply to the other personal numbers.
