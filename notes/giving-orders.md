The instructions above are neutral and can be used when speaking to children and adults, formally or informally.
The remaining phrases in this unit, however, are usually only used when addressing children or a close friend. (They are also used occasionally when someone is too annoyed to use the more polite form!)
So don't use the orders and instructions below when you are speaking to someone who isn't a member of the family or a friend, because you might cause offence.

SPELLING: THE GOLDEN RULE
The following rule applies when you are spelling in Irish:

Caol le caol agus leathan le leathan.
(Slender with slender and broad with broad.)

This refers to the type of vowel on each side of a consonant or group of consonants. The broad vowels are a, o, and u, and the slender consonants ones are e and i.

Therefore, the vowels on each side of a consonant must match in words made up of more than one syllable:
Broad vowels	Slender vowels
fanaigí	imigí
ólaigí	goitsigí
