# 15: Location and movement part 1

ASKING WHERE SOMETHING IS


The word ó (from) adds a séimhiú to nouns beginning with a consonant (except l, n, or r):
trasna ó theach Bhríd

'From the' is one word in Irish: ón.
trasna ón bhanc across from the bank

Again, note that ón adds a séimhiú to some consonants
(the exceptions being d, n, t, l, and s):
trasna ón bhialann
but
trasna ón siopa
