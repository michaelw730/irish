* When counting in Irish and using a noun there are a few things to remember.
dó changes to dhá
ceathair changes to ceithre
for the numbers 1 to 6, you aspirate or add a séimhiú
for the numbers 7 to 10, you eclipse or add an urú
As a reminder, the consonant s doesn't take an urú - so we don't add anything in front of the word seomra when counting from 7 to 10.
