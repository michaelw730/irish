## What is a pronoun?

A pronoun is a word that is used to take the place of nouns in a sentence. Some personal pronouns in English include I, me, you, he, she, we or they.

Here are a list of pronouns used in Irish.

|sé / é	|he, him, it
|sí / í	|she, her, it
|sinn / muid	|we, us
|sibh	|you (plural)
|siad / iad	|they, them


There are also certain forms of these pronouns called emphatic forms.

These are used when you want to place emphasis on the personal pronoun.

## Prepositional pronouns

As a reminder, prepositions are words in a language which tell you more about where something is - for example, under, with, or on in English.

Learn more about the prepositions in Irish in this guide.

In Irish, when a preposition and a pronoun come together, they are combined into what is called a prepositional pronoun. For example - le means with, and mé means me. In English this would go together as with me - but in Irish le mé becomes liom.

Below are all the prepositional pronouns and their different forms you should learn.

It can be difficult to remember all the different prepositional pronouns - but just be patient with yourself and test yourself often!
