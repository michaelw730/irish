# Time

If you're asking a stranger you should use the phrase, Gabh mo leithscéal (Excuse me) first in order to attract their attention. If you're already talking to someone you can use the  second phrase:


When you're responding to the question Cad é an t-am atá sé? you can leave out Tá sé ... if you wish and simply say the time.

Note: times seem similar in Irish as English (twenty past 8 etc)
