THE PAST TENSE
In the case of regular verbs, the past tense is formed by adding a séimhiú to the imperative of the verb if it begins with a consonant:

|Irish|English|Phonetic|Sound|Info|
|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|suigh síos| sit down
|shuigh sé síos |he sat down
|druid |close
|dhruid sí |she closed

If the verb begins with f or with a vowel, you place d' before it:

|Irish|English|Phonetic|Sound|Info|
|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|ól |drink
|d'ól mé |I drank
|fan |wait	
|d'fhan mé |I waited

IRREGULAR VERBS

As we mentioned before, Irish only has a handful of verbs that don't follow all the rules. Here are the past-tense forms of those verbs:


|Irish|English|Phonetic|Sound|Info|
|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|bhí mé |I was
|rinne mé |I did/made|
|chuala tú |you heard|(throaty) cwilla to
|dúirt sé |he said|doortch sheh
|fuair sí |she got|foo-er she
|d'ith muid |we ate	|dgee mwidg
|chonaic sibh |you saw|(throaty) honic shiv
|thug siad |they gave|hug shade
|chuaigh mé |I went|who-e meh
|rug sí ar |she caught|rug she ar
|tháinig sé |he came|hanig sheh

* [Doing things on Days of the Week](dates.md#doing-things-on-days-of-the-week)

There's no need to place anything before the days of the week in Irish if you want to say 'on a particular day':

Chonaic mé Síle Dé Luain. |I saw Síle on Monday.

The days of the week aren't affected if they're preceded by the words maidin and tráthnóna:

|Irish|English|Phonetic|Sound|Info|
|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|maidin Dé Máirt	|Tuesday morning
|tráthnóna Déardaoin	|Thursday evening

After oíche, however, Dé is dropped and a séimhiú is added,Luain, remains the same, and Dé hAoine loses its h:

|oíche Luain|Monday night| 
|oíche Mháirt|Tuesday night|
|oíche Chéadaoin|Wednesday night|

|go dtí an banc	|to the bank
|chuig dráma	|to a play

Chuig is used when you're talking about going to an event, an appointment, or a meeting. Chuig is also used when you are referring to sending something (such as a letter), or to motion:
