# What you want

ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY WANT



When responding to the question Cad é ba mhaith leat? you can drop Ba mhaith liom and simply say the name of the thing you want.

If you're in company and the question Cad é ba mhaith libh? is being addressed to the group as a whole, than you can use domhsa and liomsa to answer specifically for yourself:

[what-you-want.csv](what-you-want.csv)

The word duitse means 'for you' or 'to you' and is made up of the following:
do (for / to) + tú (you) + se (which is used to add emphasis to tú).

Earlier we saw the word domhsa, which means 'for me' or 'to me' and is a combination of the following elements:
do (for / to) + mé (me) + sa (which is used to add emphasis to mé).
