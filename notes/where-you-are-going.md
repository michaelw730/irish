ASKING SOMEONE WHERE THEY ARE GOING


^ MW - notice the t in front of vowels

There are different ways of saying 'to' in Irish, depending on where you're going. Go is used in front of names of places and other nouns that are not preceded by the article an (the):


Masculine and feminine nouns behave in different ways when they're preceded by the definite article an. Look at the examples below:


| Masuline         | Feminine                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
|                  | Words beginning with a consonant: |
| an banc          | an bhialann                       |
|                  |                                   |
|                  | Words beginning with s:           |
| an siopa         | an tsráid                         |
|                  |                                   |
|                  | Words beginning with a vowel:     |
| an t-ollmhargadh | an oifig                          |

Keep an eye out for this, but don't worry to much about it at this stage!
