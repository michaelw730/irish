ASKING SOMEONE WHERE THEY ARE GOING


^ MW - notice the t in front of vowels

There are different ways of saying 'to' in Irish, depending on where you're going. Go is used in front of names of places and other nouns that are not preceded by the article an (the):


Masculine and feminine nouns behave in different ways when they're preceded by the definite article an. Look at the examples below:


| Masuline         | Feminine                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
|                  | Words beginning with a consonant: |
| an banc          | an bhialann                       |
|                  |                                   |
|                  | Words beginning with s:           |
| an siopa         | an tsráid                         |
|                  |                                   |
|                  | Words beginning with a vowel:     |
| an t-ollmhargadh | an oifig                          |

Keep an eye out for this, but don't worry to much about it at this stage!

The word chuig is used instead of go or go dtí when you're talking about going to an event or to see a person. We'll deal with chuig in more detail in Aonad 11.
*Go doesn't affect words that begin with a consonant, but if the name begins with a vowel, h is placed before it.
* times are different in other dialects
