AG BUALADH LE DAOINE  MEETING PEOPLE 

GREETING SOMEONE 

The most common greeting is: 

Cad é mar atá tú? 

This greeting is sometimes preceded by Haló. 

GREETING MORE THAN ONE PERSON 

Cad é mar atá sibh? 

How are you? 

RESPONDING TO A GREETING 

Tá mé go maith. 

I’m fine. 

or simply 

Go maith. 

People often add: 

... go raibh maith agat. 

Agus tú féin? 

... thank you. 

And yourself? 

When responding to Agus tú féin? people generally avoid repeating Tá 
mé go maith and use instead Tá mé go breá. Listen to some of the 
recorded examples. 

—Cad é mar atá tú? 

—Go maith, go raibh maith agat.  Agus tú féin? 

—Tá mé go breá. 

—Cad é mar atá tú? 
—Tá mé go maith. Agus tú féin? 
—Go breá.

1.  Imagine that you meet a friend in the street. Listen to the 
recording and respond in the appropriate way. 

—Cad é mar atá tú? 

Say you’re fine and ask how she is. 

—Go breá. 

This time you meet a friend called Alan. Greet him. 

—Á, go maith. Agus tú féin? 

Say you’re fine. 

Dia duit (literally ‘God be with you’) is also used as a greeting but is regarded as 
quite formal by native speakers and is rarely used in the Gaeltacht. 

The words mé and tú are called pronouns and are used when you 
don’t need to or want to repeat a noun. Here is a list of pronouns, 
accompanied by the present tense of the verb bí (be). 

Tá mé (I am) 

Tá tú (you are) 

Tá muid (we are) 

Tá sibh (you are) 

Tá sé / sí (he / she is) 

Tá siad (they are) 

We’ll be dealing with pronouns in more detail in Aonad 5. 

TALKING ABOUT THE  WEATHER 

People often comment on the weather after they’ve exchanged greetings. 

Tá lá breá ann. 
Tá drochlá ann inniu. 
Tá sé fuar. 
Tá sé te. 
Tá sé fliuch. 
Tá, cinnte. 

It’s a fine day. 
It’s a bad day today. 
It’s cold. 
It’s hot / warm. 
It’s wet. 
It is indeed. 

Buíochas le Dia (thank God) is used quite frequently in this context. 

Tá lá breá ann inniu, buíochas le Dia. 

It’s a fine day today, thank God.

4.  YOUR BIG CHANCE! 

You’ve just been given a part in a new soap opera, but the script has had coffee 
spilled on it. See if you can fill in the gaps. 

Pól: Haló. Cad é mar atá tú? 
Áine: Go maith,  __ __   __ __ __ __ __  maith agat. Agus tú féin? 
Pól: Go  __ __ __ __. Tá  __ __   __ __ __ __  ann inniu. 
Áine: Tá  __ __ __ __ __ __. 

5.   Imagine you bump into a friend on your way to work. Listen to the 
recording and participate in the conversation. 

—Cad é mar atá tú? 

Say you’re fine and ask how she is. 

 —Go breá. Tá lá breá ann inniu. 
Say, ‘It is indeed, thank God.’     

SAYING GOODBYE 

Slán. 

Slán go fóill. 

Goodbye 

Goodbye for now 

You can respond to Slán with another Slán, or with Slán go fóill. If, however, the first 
person says Slán go fóill, the second person simply says Slán. You also hear the following: 

Chífidh mé tú. 

I’ll see you.
