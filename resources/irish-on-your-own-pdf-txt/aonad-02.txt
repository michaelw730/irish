ASKING SOMEONE’S NAME 

C’ainm atá ort? 

What’s your name? 

If you wish to ask the same question after you have given your name, then use the 
following: 

C’ainm atá ortsa? 

What’s your name? 

People normally respond to this question by simply giving their name. 

Listen to these examples. 

—Is mise Máirín. C’ainm atá ortsa? 
—Gearóid. 

—Mise Betty. C’ainm atá ortsa? 
—Rónán. 

—C’ainm atá ort? 
—Eibhlín. C’ainm atá ortsa? 
—Séamas Ó Briain. 

1.  Imagine your name is Pat. You’re at a party and you’re meeting 
some of the people there for the first time. See how you get on. 

—Mise Frank. C’ainm atá ortsa? 
Say who you are.

The Irish for ‘surname’ is sloinne. Most surnames in Ireland are 
of Irish origin and therefore have an Irish-language version. 
You’ll notice some differences between men’s and women’s 
surnames. 

Men’s and boys’ surnames usually have Mac (son) or Ó 
(grandson or descendant of) at the beginning. 

If their family surname begins with Ó, girls and unmarried 
women have Ní (daughter of) at the beginning. Some married 
women have Bean Uí (wife of) or just Uí before their surnames. 

If their family surname begins with Mac, girls and unmarried 
women have Nic (daughter of) at the beginning, and married 
women can have Bean Mhic (wife of) or just Mhic at the 
beginning of theirs. 

3.  Match each name with its Irish version.

FILLINGS IN FORMS 

Sloinne 

Surname 

Cad é an sloinne atá ort? 

What’s your surname? 

The alphabet in Irish is similar to the English alphabet. 
However, the letter j, k, q, v, w, x, y and z do not occur in 
native Irish words. Some of these letters are used 
occasionally in spelling loanwords from English, for 
example jab (job) and veain (van). 

Listen to the alphabet as it is spoken on the recording. Note 
how a is pronounced in Irish. If there’s a síneadh fada or 
accent mark placed on any of the vowels, it lengthens its 
sound. Listen again to the recording and pay attention to 
the difference in sound between these pairs of words: 

ar 

fear 

fionn 

solas 

gunna 

(on) 

(man) 

(blond) 

(light) 

(gun) 

ár 

féar 

fíon 

sólás 

gúna 

(our) 

(grass) 

(wine) 

(comfort) 

(dress)

The Irish for ‘my’ is mo. If it precedes a word beginning 
with a consonant (other than l, n, or r) a h is added to the 
initial letter, causing a change in sound: 

mac 

mo mhac 

If mo precedes a word beginning with a vowel or f, the o in 
mo is dropped: 

iníon 

m’iníon 

6.  You’ll hear some people introduce their children. Try to

Áine, Caoimhe and Róisín. 

7.  You’re shopping with your son Fearghal and daughter Niamh 
when you meet a friend. Listen to the recording and respond to your 
friend’s questions. 

—Á, cad é mar atá tú? 
Say ‘Fine, thanks,’ and ask how she is. 

—Go breá. Cé hiad seo? 
Introduce your son and daughter to her.
