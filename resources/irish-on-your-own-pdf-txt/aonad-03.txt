ASKING SOMEONE WHERE THEY’RE FROM 

Cá as tú? 

Where are you from? 

After giving your response, you can ask the same question in the following ways: 

Cá as tusa? 
or 
Cá as tú féin? 

Where are you from? 

Where are you from yourself? 

SAYING WHERE YOU’RE FROM 

Is as ... mé. 

I’m from ... 

Is as Dún Geanainn mé. 

I’m from Dungannon. 

This is generally used as a statement or as a response to a general question such as 
‘Tell me a little about yourself.’ However, when answering a more specific question, 
such as Cá as tú? people tend to say As and the name of the place. 

As Léim an Mhadaidh. 

From Limavady. 

Listen to some examples on the recording. 

—Cá as tú? 
—As Doire. Cá as tú féin? 
—As Dún na nGall. 

—Cá as tú? 
—As Léim an Mhadaidh. Cá as tusa? 
—As Port an Dúnáin.

The Irish for ‘in’ is i or in. I is used before words beginning 
with a consonant, and causes an urú: 

i dTír Eoghain 
i nDún Dealgan 

If the word begins with a vowel, in is used instead: 

in Achadh na Cloiche 
in Ard Mhacha 

TALKING ABOUT LOCATION

Tá mé i mo chónaí i lár an bhaile.

... faoin tuath 

... i lár na cathrach

ASKING WHAT TIME IT IS 

Cad é an t-am atá sé? 

What time is it? 

If you’re asking a stranger you should use the phrase Gabh mo leithscéal (Excuse 
me) first in order to attract their attention. If you’re already talking to someone you 
can use the phrase 

Cad é an t-am atá sé, le do thoil? 

What time is it, please? 

SAYING WHAT  TIME  IT IS 

Tá sé ... a chlog. 

a haon a chlog 

a dó a chlog

a ceathair a chlog 

a cúig a chlog

a seacht a chlog 

a hocht a chlog 

a naoi a chlog 

a deich a chlog 

a haon déag a chlog

ceathrú i ndiaidh ...

ceathrú go dtí ... 

It’s ... o’clock 

a quarter past ...

a quarter to ... 

When you’re responding to the question Cad é an t-am atá sé? you can leave out Tá 
sé ... if you wish and simply say the time. 

Have a listen to some people on the recording saying what time it is. 

—Gabh mo leithscéal. Cad é an t-am atá sé? 
—A cúig a chlog. 

—Cad é an t-am atá sé, le do thoil?
