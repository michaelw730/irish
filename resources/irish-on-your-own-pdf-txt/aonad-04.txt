ASKING IF SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS A LANGUAGE 

An dtuigeann tú Gaeilge? 

Do you understand Irish? 

Tuigim. 

Ní thuigim. 

Yes (I do understand). 

No (I don’t understand). 

A question is formed in the present tense by placing An before the verb. This 
causes an urú in verbs beginning with a consonant (except l, m, n, r, or s): 

An dtuigeann tú? 

Do you understand? 

(This An tends not to be pronounced in everyday speech.) 

As you’ve probably noticed, there’s no equivalent of the words ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in 
Irish. You must listen to the question and use the same verb in your answer: 

An ólann tú caife? 

Do you drink coffee? 

Ólaim. 

Ní ólaim. 

Yes. 

No. 

When Ní precedes a verb beginning with a consonant (except l, n, or r) it 
causes a séimhiú: 

Ní thuigim. 

I don’t understand. 

Only a handful of Irish verbs (eleven, to be precise) are irregular, but they 
occur quite frequently. You’ve already come across one of the most widely 
used: Tá. 

An bhfuil Gaeilge agat? 

Can you speak Irish? 

Tá. 

Níl. 

Yes. 

No. 

You’ll have plenty of opportunities to practise using verbs between now and 
the end of the course, so don’t worry unduly about them!
