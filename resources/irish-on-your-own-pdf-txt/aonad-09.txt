The instructions above are neutral and can be used when speaking to 
children and to adults, formally or informally. 

The remaining phrases in this unit, however, are usually only used when 
addressing children or a close friend. (They’re also used occasionally 
when someone is too annoyed to use the more polite form!) 

So don’t use the orders and instructions below when speaking to 
someone who isn’t a member of the family or a friend, because you 
might cause offence. 

We’ll be dealing with more polite instructions later in the course!

SPELLING: THE GOLDEN RULE 

The following rule applies when you’re spelling in Irish: 
Caol le caol agus leathan le leathan. 
(Slender with slender and broad with broad.) 

This refers to the type of vowel on each side of a consonant or group of 
consonants. The broad vowels are a, o, and u, and the slender ones are e 
and i. 

Therefore, the vowels on each side of a consonant must match in words 
made up of more than one syllable: 

Broad vowels 

Slender vowels 

fanaigí 

ólaigí 

imígí 

goitsigí 

4  

Give the appropriate orders or instructions. 

1.  You’d like a window opened. 

2.  You have an important call to make but your brother has been on the 

phone for twenty minutes. 

3.  A visitor to the house is about to trip over the rug. 

4.  You want your children to go to bed. 

5.  The room is becoming very cold. 

6.  Someone wearing muddy boots is walking on your newly washed 

floor.
