Aonad 10 

The Irish equivalents of word like ‘my’ and ‘your’ that 
denote possession affect words in different ways: 

mo (my) 
do (your) 
a (his) 
a (her) 
ár (our) 
bhur (your) 
a (their) 

mo mhac 
do mháthair 
a bhean 
a fear 
ár bpáistí 
bhur gclann 
a bpáistí 

m’iníon 
d’athair 
a iníon 
a hathair 
ár n-athair 
bhur n-iníon 
a n-athair 

Mo and other words above that denote possession are never 
stressed in everyday speech. You add certain endings in 
order to add emphasis: 

mo mhacsa 
do mháthairse 
d’iníonsa 

my son 
your mother 
your daughter

    Say you live in Belfast, and ask him where he lives. 

Friend:  —I Ros Treabhair. Cad é mar atá Pat agus do mhac   

    Brian? 
    Say they’re fine, and ask how his son is.

The nouns following the personal numbers are 
usually in the genitive plural (although some of

nominative singular). Just learn the following 
examples for now: 
seisear iníonacha 
triúr mac 
ceathrar buachaillí 
cúigear cailíní 

On last thing to remember: words beginning 
with a consonant take a séimhiú after beirt.
