THE PAST TENSE 
In the case of regular verbs, the past tense is formed by adding a 
séimhiú to the imperative of the verb if it begins with a consonant: 

suigh síos (sit down) 
druid (close) 

shuigh sé síos (he sat down) 
dhruid sí (she closed) 

If the verb begins with an f or with a vowel, you place d’ before it: 

ól (drink) 
fan (wait) 

d’ól mé (I drank) 
d’fhan mé (I waited) 

IRREGULAR VERBS 
As we mentioned before, Irish has only a handful of verbs that don’t 
follow all the rules. Here are the past-tense forms of those verbs: 

bhí mé (I was) 
rinne mé (I did) 
chuala tú (you heard) 
dúirt sé (he said) 
fuair sí (she got) 
d’ith muid (we ate) 

chonaic sibh (you saw) 
thug siad (they gave) 
chuaigh mé (I went) 
rug sí ar (she caught) 
tháinig sé (he came) 

4.  Try saying the following in Irish. 

I saw Brian yesterday. 
I went to Belfast at the weekend.

3.  I drank two pints last night.

Chuig is used when you’re talking about going to an event, an 
appointment, or a meeting. Chuig is also used when you’re referring to 
sending something (such as a letter), or to motion: 

Chuaigh mé chuig an dochtúir. 
Chuir mé litir chuig Anna. 
Chaith sé cnámh chuig an 
mhadadh. 

I went to the doctor. 
I sent a letter to Anna.
