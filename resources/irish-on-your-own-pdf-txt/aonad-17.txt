AG IARRAIDH RUDAÍ  ASKING FOR THINGS 

SAYING WHAT YOU WANT 

Tá mé ag iarraidh … 

I want 

This phrase is often used when buying something—in a shop or in a pub, for example. 
Tá mé ag iarraidh pionta beorach. 

I want a pint of beer. 

Children are also fond of using Tá mé ag iarraidh! 
Tá mé ag iarraidh gloine oráiste. 

I want a glass of orange. 

Adults tend to avoid using Tá mé ag iarraidh in the way children do, in order not to 
sound abrupt. They usually use it as a statement of what they want or would like 
rather than as a demand. 

Listen to these examples on the recording. 

—Tá mé ag iarraidh cupa tae. Ar mhaith leatsa ceann? 

—Ba mhaith, go raibh maith agat. 

—Tá mé ag iarraidh a dhul abhaile ag a naoi a chlog ach ní thig 

liom. Tá mé an-ghnóthach.

or 

Cad é atá de dhíth ort?* 

What do you want? 

Cad é atá de dhíth oraibh?* 

(plural) 

*the de in this phrase is not said in everyday speech.
