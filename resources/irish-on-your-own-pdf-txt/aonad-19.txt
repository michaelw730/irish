If you want to tell someone to stop doing something, 
you place Ná before the imperative form of the verb. 
Ná doesn’t affect words beginning with a consonant, 
but it prefixes h to vowels: 

Ná déan sin 
Ná habair sin. 

Don’t do that. 
Don’t say that.

4.  Don’t laugh.

2.   Here’s  a  chance  for  you  to  practise  some  of  the  phrases  you’ve

say in the following situations?

If you’re responding to the question Cad é atá ort? you can shorten the phrases that 
contain orm:

The structure … i mo bholg follows the same rules as …
