AG TABHAIRT CUIRÍ  GIVING INVITATIONS 

GIVING INVITATIONS 

Ar mhaith leat ... 

Would you like ... 

a dhul chuig dráma liom? 

to go to a play with me? 

a dhul ag rith? 

cluiche gailf a imirt? 

to go running? 

to play a game of golf? 

a theacht ag siopadóireacht liom? 

to come shopping with me? 

a theacht isteach? 

suí síos? 

to come in? 

to sit down? 

ACCEPTING AND REFUSING AN INVITATION 

Ba mhaith. 

Níor mhaith. 

Ba bhreá liom. 

I would. 

I wouldn’t. 

I’d love to.  

Cinnte. Níl mé gnóthach inniu. 

Certainly. I’m not busy today. 

Tá brón orm—ní thig liom.  

I’m sorry—I can’t. 

Have a listen to some people accepting and refusing 
invitations. 

–Ar mhaith leat a dhul chuig cluiche peile liom tráthnóna? 

–Tá brón orm—ní thig liom.  

–Cad chuige?

GIVING EXCUSES 

Tá mé ag tabhairt aire do na páistí.  

I’m looking after the children. 

Tá mé ag cóiriú an chairr. 

I’m repairing the car. 

Tá mé ag péinteáil an tí. 

I’m painting the house. 

Tá mé róthuirseach. 

Tá mé an-ghnóthach 

I’m too tired. 

I’m very busy. 

We already looked at the genitive case in Aonad 18. The 
genitive also comes after verbal nouns—that is, the Irish 
equivalents of those words that end in—ing in English: 

an carr 
ag cóiriú an chairr 

an teach 
ag glanadh an tí 

the car 
repairing the car 

the house 
cleaning the house 

Look out for more examples of the genitive case in other 
units. 

1.  You’ll hear people on the recording inviting friends to go somewhere 
or to do something. Reply to the invitations before each person does. 

1.  Certainly. I’m not busy today. 

2.  I can’t. I have to go to the supermarket. 

3.  I’d love to. 

4.  I’d love to, but I’m looking after the children. 

5.  I can’t. I’m repairing the car. 

ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY’LL BE DOING 

Before inviting someone to do something, you might ask first whether they will be free. 

Cad é atá tú a dhéanamh ... 
tráthnóna? 
san oíche amárach? 
anocht? 

What are you doing ... 
this evening? 
tomorrow night? 
tonight? 

SAYING YOU’RE DOING NOTHING 

Dadaí. 

Nothing.
