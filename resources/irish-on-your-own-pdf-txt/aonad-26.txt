ASKING SOMEONE HOW MANY CHILDREN THEY HAVE 

In Aonad 10 you learnt how to ask someone how many children they have: 

Cá mhéad páiste atá agat? 

Another way of asking this question is: 

Cá mhéad duine clainne atá agat? 

4.  You’ll hear different people saying how long they’ve been married and 
how many children they have. Try to anticipate what each of them is going 
to say. (Before attempting this exercise, go back to Aonad 10 if you’ve forgotten 
how to count people.) 

1.  Helen is married for twenty years and has two sons and 

three daughters. 

2.  Dara is married for six years. He has no children. 

3.  Máirtín is married for nearly ten years. He has one daughter 

and three sons. 

4.  Julie is married for twenty-two years. She has four 

daughters.

5.    This  exercise  will  give  you  an  opportunity  to  practise  using  the  word 
cónaí, which we dealt with in Aonad 13.  You’ll hear three different people 
being asked where their children now live. Again, try to answer before each 
person does. 

1.  They live in Belfast. 

2.  Pól lives in Dublin, and Simon lives in Cork. 

3.  Maria lives in Scotland, and Mairéad and Gerry live in England. 

ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY’RE RELATED TO A PARTICULAR 
PERSON 

Sometimes you meet someone who has the same surname as someone else you know, or 
who looks like someone you know. To find out if they’re related you can ask: 

An bhfuil tú muinteartha do ... 

Are you related to ... ? 

An bhfuil tú muinteartha do Mháire? 

Are you related to Máire? 

An bhfuil tú muinteartha di? 

Are you related to her? 

An bhfuil tú muinteartha dó? 

Are you related to him? 

An bhfuil tú muinteartha dóibh? 

Are you related to them? 

SAYING HOW YOU’RE RELATED TO SOMEONE 

Is deartháir liom é. 

Is deirfiúr liom í. 

He’s a brother of mine. 

She’s a sister of mine. 

Is col ceathracha muid. 

We’re cousins. 

Níl muid muinteartha ar chor ar bith.  We’re not related at all. 

Listen to some examples on the recording. Look out for the phrase Tá sibh an-
chosúil le chéile (You’re very alike). 

–A Bhríd, ar mhaith leat a dhul go Doire ag siopadóireacht Dé Sathairn? 

–Ní thig liom. Tá mé ag dul chuig bainis Yvonne Ní Fhearraigh. 

–An bhfuil tú muinteartha di? 

–Tá. Is col ceathracha muid. 

–An bhfuil tusa muinteartha do Sheán Ó Riain? 

–Tá. Is deartháir liom é. 

–Tá sibh an-chosúil le chéile.

6.  Imagine that  you’re a guest at the wedding of two friends, Dónall and 
Eibhlín. See how you get on in the following conversation with one of the 
other guests.  

–An bhfuil tú muinteartha do Dhónall? 

Say, ‘Yes, we’re cousins,‘ and ask him if he’s related to Eibhlín. 

–Tá. Is deirfiúr liom í. 

Say, ‘You’re very alike.’
