Aonad 29 

There are different ways of saying ‘in’ a country in Irish, depending on 
whether or not the name of the country is preceded by the article, an. If it 
is, you use sa before a consonant and san before a vowel:  

an Fhrainc 
sa Fhrainc 

an Iodáil 
san Iodáil 

France 
in France 

Italy 
in Italy 

If the name of the country is not preceded by an, you use i before a 
consonant and in before a vowel: 

Meiriceá 
i Meiriceá 

Albain 
in Albain 

America 
in America 

Scotland 
in Scotland 

Where the name is preceded by the plural article, sna is used: 

na Stáit Aontaithe 
sna Stáit Aontaithe 

the United states 
in the United States 

Have a listen now to people discussing being abroad. Look out for the 
phrase Nach tú atá ag amharc go maith! (Aren’t you looking well!). 

–Cad é mar atá tú, a Bhriain? Ní fhaca mé le fada tú. An raibh tú thar lear? 

–Bhí. Bhí mé sa Ghearmáin ar feadh trí mhí. 

–Ní fhaca mé le fada tú, a Chaitríona. 

–Bhí mé thar lear. 

–Ó, cá háit a raibh tú? 

–Bhí mé ag obair sa Spáinn ar feadh sé mhí.  

–Cad é mar atá tú, a Nuala? 

–Tá mé go breá.

SAYING HOW LONG YOU WERE ABROAD 

We already came across ar feadh (for) in Aonad 18. It can also be used when referring to the 
past. 

Aonad 29 

Bhí mé ansin ... 

ar feadh míosa 

ar feadh dhá mhí 

ar feadh seacht mí 

ar feadh bliana 

I was there ... 

for a month 

for two months 

for seven months 

for a year 

1.  You’ll hear different people being asked where they’ve been. Try to give 
the answer before each person does. 

1.  I was in America for eight months. 

2.  I was in Spain for three months. 

3.  I was in Germany for six months. 

4.  I was in England for a year. 

5.  I was in the United States for a month. 

As you saw in Aonad 18, nouns that directly follow ar feadh are in the 
genitive case, and most undergo some change: 

mí—ar feadh míosa 

bliain—ar feadh bliana 

However, if a number is placed between ar feadh and the noun, there is 
no change other than that caused by the number: 

ar feadh dhá mhí 

ar feadh ocht mí 

ar feadh dhá bhliain 

You can use ar feadh to refer to a period in the past that is finished: 

Bhí mé ansin ar feadh bliana.  

I was there for a year. 

Le, which we came across in Aonad 26, is used to refer to something 
that is continuing: 

Ta mé i mo chónaí anseo le cúig 
bliana. 

I’m living here for five years.
