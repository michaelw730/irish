ASKING WHERE SOMETHING IS
Cá bhfuil ...? Where is/are ...?
Cá bhfuil oifig an phoist? Where is the post office?
Cá bhfuil do charr? Where is your car?

SAYING WHERE SOMETHING IS
... ar chlé ... on the left
... ar dheis ... on the right
Tá sé ansin ar chlé. It's there on the left.
Tá sé anseo ar dheis. It's here on the right.
Tá sé trasna ón siopa. It's across from the shop.
Tá sé in aice leis an chaife. It's beside the cafe.
The word ó (from) adds a séimhiú to nouns beginning with a consonant (except l, n, or r):
trasna ó theach Bhríd

'From the' is one word in Irish: ón.
trasna ón bhanc across from the bank

Again, note that ón adds a séimhiú to some consonants
(the exceptions being d, n, t, l, and s):
trasna ón bhialann
but
trasna ón siopa
ASKING HOW MANY ROOMS THERE ARE IN A HOUSE
Cá mhéad seomra atá ann? How many rooms are in it?

Here are some possible answers:
Tá trí sheomra ann. It has three rooms.

If you are not sure why it is trí sheomra but ocht seomra, go back to Unit 6.
