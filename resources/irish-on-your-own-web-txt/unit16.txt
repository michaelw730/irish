COUNTING THE POUNDS
Punt is a regular noun and follows the rules you learnt earlier for counting things.
punt	one pound
dhá phunt	two pounds
trí phunt	three pounds
ceithre phunt	four pounds
cúig phunt	five pounds
sé phunt	six pounds
seacht bpunt	seven pounds
naoi bpunt	nine pounds
deich bpunt	ten pounds

Eleven pounds is aon punt déag

12-19 are easy to remember: simply add déag to 2-9 pounds:
dhá phunt déag
cúig phunt déag
ocht bpunt déag

Twenty pounds is fiche punt
DEALING WITH QUANTITIES
an ceann	each
an dosaen	per dozen
an mála	per bag
an buidéal	per bottle
an bosca	per box
an cileagram	per kilogram
an punt	per pound
an lítear	per litre
an pionta	per pint
LOOKING AFTER THE PENNIES
The word pingin (penny) is irregular and doesn't follow the rules for counting things.
pingin	one penny
dhá phingin	two pence
trí pingine	three pence
ceithre pingine	four pence
cúig pingine	five pence
sé pingine	six pence
seacht bpingine	seven pence
ocht bpingine	eight pence
naoi bpingine	nine pence
deich bpingine	ten pence

Remember this pattern:
1p	2p	3-6p	7-10p
pingin	dhá phingin	... pingine	... bpingine

Eleven pence is aon phingin déag.

Again just add déag to 2-9 pence to get 12-19 pence.
ceithre pingine* déag
naoi bpingine* déag
* When you listen to the tape you'll notice that the e is not pronounced before the word déag.

Twenty pence is fiche pingin.
