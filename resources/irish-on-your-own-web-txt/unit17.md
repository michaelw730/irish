17: Asking for things

SAYING WHAT YOU WANT
Tá mé ag iarraidh ... I want ...

This phrase is often used when buying something- in a shop or a pub for example.
Tá mé ag iarraidh pionta beorach. I want a pint of beer.

Children are also fond of using Tá mé ag iarraidh!
Tá mé ag iarraidh gloine oráiste. I want a glass of orange.

Adults tend to avoid using Tá mé ag iarraidh in the way children do, in order not to sound abrupt. They usually use it as a statement of what they want or would like rather than as a demand.
ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY WANT OR WOULD LIKE
Cad é atá tú ag iarraidh?
or
Cad é atá de dhíth ort?* What do you want?
Cad é atá de dhíth oraibh?* What do you want? (plural)
*The de in this phrase is not said in everday speech.

If you don't know what you want you can say
Níl a fhios agam. I don't know.
ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY WANT A PARTICULAR THING
An bhfuil tú ag iarraidh ...? Do you want ...?
The phrase Cad é atá de dhíth ort? literally means 'what is lacking on you?' Ort is made up of ar (on) + tú (you).
orm	on me	orainn	on us
ort	on you	oraibh	on you
air	on him	orthu	on them
uirthi	on her		

Cad é atá de dhíth air? What does he want?
Cad é atá de dhíth uirthi? What does she want?
Cad é atá de dhíth orthu? What do they want?
OFFERING ASSISTANCE
An dtiocfadh liom cuidiú leat? May I help you? (literally, Could I help you?)
SAYING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
Tá mé ag cuartú ... I'm looking for ...

This phrase is often used when shopping.
Tá mé ag cuartú ... I'm looking for ...
péire bróg. a pair of shoes.

ASKING FOR MORE DETAILS
Cad é cineál? What kind?
Cad é dath? What colour?

If someone is asking you to choose between two things they'll say:

If there are more than two things to choose from you can either use:

again or
