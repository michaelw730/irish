TELLING SOMEONE TO BE QUIET

or

Let's look now at a negative order:
Ná bí ag caint. Stop talking. (literally, Don't be talking.)

SPEAKING TO CHILDREN
Ná bí ag caoineadh. Don't cry.

If you want to tell someone to stop doing something, you place Ná before the imperative form of the verb. Ná doesn't affect words beginning with a consonant, but it prefixes h to vowels:
