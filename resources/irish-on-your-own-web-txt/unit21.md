21: Giving invitations

GIVING INVITATIONS
Ar mhaith leat ... Would you like ...
a dhul chuig dráma liom? to go to a play with me?
a dhul ag rith? to go running?
cluiche gailf a mirt? to play a game of golf?
a theacht ag siopadóireacht liom? to come shopping with me?
a theacht isteach? to come in?
suí síos? to sit down?
ACCEPTING AND REFUSING INVITATIONS
Ba mhaith. I would.
Níor mhaith. I wouldn't.
Ba bhreá liom. I'd love to.
Cinnte. Níl mé gnóthach innui. Certainly. I'm not busy today.
Tá brón orm - ní thig liom. I'm sorry - I can't.
GIVING EXCUSES
Tá mé ag tabhairt aire do na páistí. I'm looking after the children.
Tá mé ag cóiriú an chairr. I'm repairing the car.
Tá mé ag péinteáil an tí. I'm painting the house.
Tá mé róthuirseach. I'm too tired.
Tá mé an-gnóthach. I'm very busy.
We already looked at the genitive case in Aonad 18. The genitive also comes after verbal nouns- that is, the Irish equivalents of those words that end in -ing in English:
an carr	the carr
ag cóiriú an chairr	repairing the car
an teach	the house
ag glanadh an tí	cleaning the house

Look out for more examples of the genitive case in other units.
ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING
Before inviting someone to do something, you might ask first whether they will be free.
Cad é atá a dhéanamh ... What are you doing ...
tráthnóna? this evening?
san oíche amárach? tomorrow night?
anocht? tonight?
SAYING YOU ARE DOING NOTHING.
Dadaí. Nothing.

An mbeidh tú gnóthach oíche Shathairn? Will you be busy on Saturday night?
