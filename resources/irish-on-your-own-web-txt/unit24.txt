24: Exchanging news

ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY HAVE ANY NEWS
An bhfuil nuacht ar bith agat? Have you any news?

Here is a common response:
Muise, níl. Indeed I haven't.
ASKING SOMEONE IF THERE'S ANYTHING HAPPENING
An bhfuil an dhath ag dhul? Is there anything happening?
Ní mórán. Not much.
TELLING GOOD NEWS
Fuair m'fhear céile post úr. My husband got a new job.
Cheannaigh mé carr úr Dé Luain. I bought a new car on Monday.
Bhí leanbh ag Bríd arú aréir. Bríd had a baby the night before last.
REACTING TO GOOD NEWS
Sin dea-scéala! That's good news!
Tá lúcháir orm sin a chloisteáil. I'm glad to hear that.
Is maith sin. That's good.
Comhghairdeachas! Congratulations!
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN THE PAST
We've already looked at how the past tense is formed. We'll now turn our attention to asking and answering questions in that tense.

REGULAR VERBS
With regular verbs, you place Ar before the past tense form:
Cheannaigh mé ...	I bought ...
Ar cheannaigh tú ...?	Did you buy ...?
Cheannaigh. / Níor cheannaigh.	I did (buy). / I didn't (buy).
Ar bhuail tú le Laura?	Did you meet Laura?
Bhuail. / Níor bhuail.	I did (meet). / I didn't (meet).

IRREGULAR VERBS
These are commonly used verbs, so it's worth learning the correct forms.
An raibh tú ...?	Were you ...?
Bhí. / Ní raibh.	
An ndearna tú ...?	Did you do/make ...?
Rinne. / Ní dhearna.	
Ar chuala tú ...?	Did you hear ...?
Chuala. / Níor chuala.	
An bhfuair tú ...?	Did you get ...?
Fuair. / Ní bhfuair.	
Ar thug tú ...?	Did you give ...?
Thug. / Níor thug.	
An ndeachaigh tú ...?	Did you go ...?
Chuaigh. / Ní dheachaigh.	
Ar tháinig tú ...?	Did you come ...?
Tháinig. / Níor tháinig.	

An is usually not pronounced if it preceds the verb. We will be returning to the past tense in Aonad 29.
REACTING TO BAD NEWS
Sin drochscéala. That's bad news.
Tá brón orm sin a chloisteáil.
or
Tá mé buartha sin a chloisteáil. I'm sorry to hear that.
