29: Living and working abroad

GREETING SOMEONE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN FOR A WHILE
Cad é an dóigh atá ort? How are you keeping?
Ní fhaca mé le fada tú. I haven't seen you in a long time.
Ní fhaca mé le tamall tú. I haven't seen you for a while.
ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABROAD
An raibh tú thar lear? Were you abroad? or Have you been abroad?
SAYING WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN
Bhí mé thar lear. I was abroad.
SAYING WHAT COUNTRY YOU'VE BEEN TO
You learnt the names of various countries in Aonad 18. Let's look now at how you say you've been in a particular country.
Bhí mé ... I was ...
sa Spáinn in Spain
sa Ghearmáin in Germany
san Iodáil in Italy
san Astráil in Australia
i Meiriceá in America
i Sasana in England
in Albain in Scotland
There are different ways of saying 'in' a country in Irish, depending on whether or not the name of the country is preceded by the article, an.
If it is, you use sa before a consonant and san before a vowel:
an Fhrainc France
sa Fhrainc in France

an Iodáil Italy
san Iodáil in Italy

If the name of the country is not preceded by an,
you use i before a consonant and in before a vowel:
Meiriceá America
i Meiriceá in America

Albain Scotland
in Albain in Scotland

Where the name is preceded by the plural article, sna is used:
na Stáit Aontaithe the United States
sna Stáit Aontaithe in the United States
SAYING HOW LONG YOU WERE ABROAD
Bhí mé ansin ... I was there ...
ar feadh míosa for a month
ar feadh dhá mhí for two months
ar feadh seacht mí for seven months
ar feadh bliana for a year
As you saw in Aonad 18, nouns that directly follow ar feadh are in the genitive case, and most undergo some change:
mí - ar feadh míosa
bliain - ar feadh bliana

However, if a number is placed between ar feadh and the noun, there is no change other than that caused by the number:
ar feadh dhá mhí
ar feadh ocht mí
ar feadh dhá bhliain

You can use ar feadh to refer to a period in the past that is finished:
Bhí mé ansin ar feadh bliana I was there for a year.

Le, which we came across in Aonad 26, is used to refer to something that is continuing:
Tá mé i mo chónaí anseo le cúig bliana. I am living here for five years.
ASKING SOMEONE WHEN THEY CAME BACK
Cá huair a tháinig tú ar ais? When did you come back?
ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY WERE WORKING THERE
An raibh tú ag obair ansin? Were you working there?
SAYING WHAT WORK YOU DID
Bhí mé ag múineadh Bearla. I was teaching English.
Bhí mé ag tabhairt aire do pháistí. I was taking care of children.
Bhí mé ag staidéar. I was studying.
Bhí mé ag déanamh cúrsa Fraincise. I was doing a French course.
Bhí mé ag obair mar thógálaí. I was working as a builder.
SAYING THAT SOMETHING WAS GREAT
Bhí sé go hiontach. It was great.
Bbí sé go hiontach ar fad. It was really great.
SAYING WHY YOU DIDN'T ENJOY BEING SOMEWHERE
Bhí sé an-fhuar ansin. It was very cold there.
Bhí sé i bhfad róthe. It was far too hot.
Bhí cumha orm. I was homesick.
Bhí an obair róchrua. The work was too hard.
