1: AG BUALADH LE DAOINE | MEETING PEOPLE

GREETING SOMEONE

The most common greeting is
Cad é mar atá tú? How are you?
This greeting is sometimes preceded by Haló.

GREETING MORE THAN ONE PERSON

Cad é mar atá sibh? How are you

RESPONDING TO A GREETING

Tá mé go maith. I'm fine.
or simply
Go maith.
People often add
... go raibh maith agat. ... thank you.
Agus tú féin? And yourself?

When responding to Agus tú féin? people generally avoid repeating Tá mé go maith. and use instead Tá mé go breá.. Listen to some examples on the tape.
The words mé and tú are called pronouns and are used when you don't need to or want to repeat a noun. Here is a list of pronouns, accompanied by the present tense of the verb bí (be).

Tá mé (I am)
Tá tú (you are)
Tá sé/sí (he/she is)
Tá muid (we are)
Tá sibh (you are)
Tá siad (they are)

We'll be dealing with pronouns in more detail in Aonad 5.

TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER

People often comment on the weather after they've exchanged greetings.

Tá lá breá ann. It's a fine day.
Tá drochlá ann inniu. It's a bad day today.
Tá sé fuar. It's cold.
Tá sé te. It's hot/warm.
Tá sé fliuch. It's wet.
Tá, cinnte. It is indeed.
Buíochas le Dia (thank God) is used quite frequently in this context.
Tá lá breá ann inniu, buíochas le Dia. It's a fine day today, thank God.

SAYING GOODBYE
Slán. Goodbye.
Slán go fóill. Goodbye for now.

You can respond to Slán. with another Slán., or with Slán go fóill. If, however, the first person says Slán go fóill., the second person simply says Slán. You also hear the following:

Chífidh mé tú. I'll see you.
