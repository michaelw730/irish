or

ASKING SOMEONE HOW MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILY ARE
Cad é mar atá do chlann? How are your children?
(when speaking to one person)
or
Cad é mar atá do chuid páistí?

This is how you return the question:
Cad é mar atá do chlannsa? How are your children?
or
Cad é mar atá do chuid páistíse?
The Irish equivalents of word like 'my' and 'your' that denote possession affect words in different ways:
mo(my)	mo mhac	m'iníon
do(your)	do mháthair	d'athair
a(his)	a bhean	a iníon
a(her)	a fear	a hathair
ár(our)	ár bpáistí	ár n-athair
bhur(your)	bhur gclann	bhur n-iníon
a(their)	a bpáistí	a n-athair
Mo and the other words above that denote possession are never stressed in everyday speech. You add certain endings in order to add emphasis:
mo mhacsa	my son
do mháthairse	your mother
d'iníonsa	your daughter
ASKING SOMEONE HOW MANY CHILDREN THEY HAVE
Cá mhéad páiste atá agat? How many children have you?
Note that the sigular form of the noun is used after Cá mhéad?
Cá mhéad cáilín atá agat? How many girls have you?

COUNTING PEOPLE
duine amháin	one person
beirt	two people
triúr	three people
ceathrar	four people
cúigear	five people
seisear	six people
ochtar	eight people
naonúr	nine people
deichnúr	ten people

The nouns following the personal numbers are usually in the genitive plural (although some of the nouns look exactly as they do in the nominative singular). Just learn the following examples for now:
seisear iníonacha
triúr mac
ceathrar buachaillí
cúigear cailíní

One last thing to remember: words beginning with a consonant take a séimhiú after beirt.
beirt mhac
This rule doesn't apply to the other personal numbers.

Tá beirt acu ar an scoil. Two of them are at school.
