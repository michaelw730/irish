22: Illness and injuries

ASKING SOMEONE HOW THEY FEEL
Cad é mar a bhraitheann tú? How do you feel?
The phrase Cad é mar atá tú? (How are you?) is generally used as a greeting, but it can also be used to find out how someone is feeling.

You learnt in Aonad 19 how to ask what's wrong with someone:
Cad é atá ort? What's wrong with you?
Cad é atá air? What's wrong with him?
Cad é atá uirthi? What's wrong with her?
SAYING HOW YOU FEEL
Tá mé go breá. I'm fine.
Níl mé ach go measartha. I'm only middling.
Ní bhraithim go maith. I don't feel well.
Tá mé tinn. I'm sick.
NAMING ILLNESSES

CANCELING ARRANGEMENTS
Sometimes it's necessary to cancel arrangements because of illness or some injury. Here are a few useful phrases that can be used in such a situation.
Ní bheidh mé ábalta a dhul amach anocht. I won't be able to go out tonight.
Ní bheidh mé ag an chruinniú anocht. I won't be at the meeting tonight.

If you're asked the question
An mbeidh tú ansin anocht?. Will you be there tonight?

You can reply
Beidh. I will.
or
Ní bheidh. I won't.
If you feel it necessary to appologize you can use the following:
Tá brón orm. I'm sorry.
In Aonad 10 we looked at how the Irish equivalents of words like 'my' and 'your' that denote possession affect the words that follow them. Here are some more examples:
mo (my)	mo chos	m'aghaidh
do (your)	do ghlúin	d'aghaidh
a (his)	a shúil	a aghaidh
a (her)	a béal	a haghaidh

TELLING SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE
Tabhair aire duit féin. Take care of yourself.
SAYING YOU ARE BETTER OR WORSE
Tá mé ag teacht chugam féin. I'm recovering.
Tá mé níos fearr. I'm better.
Níl mé níos fearr - tá mé níos measa. I'm not better - I'm worse.
The word níos is used when comparing things in Irish. Words that follow níos are generally changed.
deas	nice
níos deise	nicer
fuar	cold
níos fuaire	colder

Adjectives that are irregular change completely:
maith	good
níos fearr	better
olc	bad
níos measa	worse
