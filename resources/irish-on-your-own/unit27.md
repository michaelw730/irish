FINDING OUT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GO FOR A MEAL
Ar mhaith leat a dhul amach fá choinne béile? Would you like to go out for a meal?
Ar mhaith leat rud éigin a ithe? Would you like to eat something?

A more indirect way of finding out if someone wants to go and get something to eat is:
An bhfuil ocras ort? Are you hungry?
OFFERING SOMEONE A DRINK
You are already familiar with the phrase:
Ar mhaith leat deoch? Would you like a drink?

Another way of asking the same question is:
An mbeidh deoch agat? Will you have a drink?

FINDING OUT WHAT SOMEONE WOULD LIKE TO DRINK
You're often asked the following question after you have ordered your food:
Cad é a ólfaidh tú?
