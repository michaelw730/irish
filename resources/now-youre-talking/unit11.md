11: Saying what you did

Information Text from the Workbook
ASKING SOMEONE WHERE THEY WENT
Cá háit a ndeachaigh* tú? Where did you go?
Cá háit a ndeachaigh* tú inné? Where did you go yesterday?
* The n at the beginning of this word is not pronounced in the Ulster dialect.
ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY DID
Cad é rinne tú? What did you do?
Cad é rinne tú ag an deireadh seachtaine? What did you do at the weekend?
REFERING TO THE RECENT PAST
inné yesterday
arú inné the day before yesterday
aréir last night
arú aréir the night before last
maidin inné yesterday morning
maidin inniú this morning
SAYING YOU WENT SOMEWHERE
Chuaigh mé ... I went ...
Chuaigh mé ag snámh. I went swimming.
Chuaigh muid ag rothaíocht. We went cycling.
SAYING WHAT YOU DID
Bhí mé ag bainis. I was at a wedding.
D'imir mé cispheil. I played basketball.
D'amharc mé ar fhíseáin. I watched videos.
D'éist mé le dlúthdhioscaí. I listened to CDs.
D'ól mé cúpla deoch. I had a few drinks.
THE PAST TENSE
In the case of regular verbs, the past tense is formed by adding a séimhiú to the imperative of the verb if it begins with a consonant:
suigh síos (sit down)	shuigh sé síos (he sat down)
druid (close)	dhruid sí (she closed)

If the verb begins with f or with a vowel, you place d' before it:
ól (drink)	d'ól mé (I drank)
fan (wait)	d'fhan mé (I waited)
IRREGULAR VERBS
As we mentioned before, Irish only has a handful of verbs that don't follow all the rules. Here are the past-tense forms of those verbs:
bhí mé (I was)	Chonaic sibh (you saw)
rinne mé (I did)	thug siad (they gave)
chuala tú (you heard)	chuaigh mé (I went gave)
dúirt sé (he said)	rug sí ar (she caught)
fuair sí (she got)	tháinig sé (he came)
d'ith muid (we ate)	
DAYS OF THE WEEK
Dé Luain	Monday
Dé Máirt	Tuesday
Dé Céadaoin	Wednesday
Déardaoin	Thursday
Dé hAoine	Friday
Dé Sathairn	Saturday
Dé Domhnaigh	Sunday

There's no need to place anything before the days of the week in Irish if you want to say 'on a particular day':
Chonaic mé síle Dé Luain. I saw Síle on Monday.
The days of the week aren't affected if they're preceded by the words maidin and tráthnóna:
maidin Dé Máirt	Tuesday morning
tráthnóna Déardaoin	Thursday evening

After oíche, however, Dé is dropped and a séimhiú is added:
oíche Mháirt	Tuesday night
oíche Shathairn	Saturday night

Luain, remains the same, and Dé hAoine loses its h:
oíche Luain	Monday night
oíche Aoine	Friday night
ASKING SOMEONE WHEN THEY WENT SOMEWHERE
Cá huair? When?
Cá huair a chuaigh tú go Leitir Ceanainn? When did you go to Letterkenney?
Cén lá a chuaigh tú go Leitir Ceanainn? What day did you go to Letterkenney?
ASKING SOMEONE WHO WAS WITH THEM
Cé a bhí leat? Who was with you?
Cé a chuaigh leat? Who went with you?
GIVING A RESPONSE
Mo chara. My friend.
Mo chara Liam. My friend Liam.
Mo chairde. My friends.
ASKING SOMEONE IF THEY ENJOYED SOMETHING
Ar bhain tú sult as? Did you enjoy it?
Ar bhain tú sult as an dráma? Did you enjoy the play?
Ar bhain tú sult as an deireadh seachtaine? Did you enjoy the weekend?
GIVING YOUR REPLY
Bhain. Yes (I did).
Níor bhain. No (I didn't).
Bhain mé an-sult as. I really enjoyed it.
In Aonad 7 we saw three different words that are used to say 'to' in Irish:
go hArd Mhacha	to Armagh
go dtí an banc	to the bank
chuig dráma	to a play

Chuig is used when you're talking about going to an event, an appointment, or a meeting. Chuig is also used when you are referring to sending something (such as a letter), or to motion:
Chuaigh mé chuig an dochtúir.	I went to the doctor.
Chuir mé litir chuig Anna.	I sent a letter to Anna.
Chaith sé cnámh chuig an mhadadh.	He threw a bone to the dog.
