2: Introductions

INTRODUCING YOURSELF
To introduce yourself you say
Is mise ... I'm...
or
Mise ...
followed by your name.
ASKING SOMEONE'S NAME
C'ainm atá ort? What's your name?
If you wish to ask the same question after you have given your name, then use the following:
C'ainm atá ortsa? What's your name?
People normally respond to this question by simply giving their name.
FILLING IN FORMS

INTRODUCING FAMILY MEMBERS
mathair mother
Seo mo mhathair.
athair father
Seo m'athair.
iníon* daughter
Seo m'iníon.
mac son
Seo mo mhac.
* In Ulster the i at the beginning of iníon is not pronounced.

This is how you introduce more than one daughter or son:
Seo mo chuid inlonacha.
Seo mo chuid mac.
The Irish for 'my' is mo. If it precedes a word beginning with a consonant (other than l, n, or r) a h is added to the initial letter, causing a change in sound:
mac = mo mhac
If mo precedes a word beginning with a vowel or f, the o in mo is dropped:
iníon = m'iníon
