23: Asking for permission and favor

ASKING FOR PERMISSION
An dtig liom ... May I ...
an fón a úsáid? use the phone?
caitheamh? smoke?
an fhuinneog a oscailt? open the window?
a dhul chuig an scannán anocht? go to the film tonight?
GIVING AND REFUSING PERMISSION
Thig. You may.
Thig, cinnte. You may indeed.
Ní thig. You may not.

If you want to add emphasis to this and say a very definite 'no' you can use leat, or libh if your addressing more than one person.
Ní thig leat! You may not!
Pay special attention to word order in the phrases you've learnt so far in this unit. In some instances it differs from English.
[An dtig liom] [an fhuinneog] [a oscailt?] [May I] [the window] [open?]
ASKING FOR FAVOURS AND MAKING REQUESTS
In units 9 and 19 you learnt how to ask children and friends to do various things, such as to open a door or to hurry up. Let's look at more polite ways of asking for favours and making requests.
An dtiocfadh leat ... Could you ...
an doras a dhruid? close the door?
scairtigh ar Bríd? call Bríd?
an litir seo a chur sa phost domh? post this letter for me?
na soithí a ní? wash the dishes?
MORE POLITE FORMS
Ar mhiste leat... Would you mind ...
páipéar nuachta a fháil domh? getting a paper for me?
an chistin a ghlanadh? cleaning the kitchen?
cuidiú liom an tábla seo a bhogadh? helping me to move this table?
ASKING TO SEE OR SPEAK TO SOMEONE
An dtig liom labhairt le ...? May I speak to ...?
An dtig liom labhairt le Séamas? May I speak to Séamas?
An dtig liom labhairt le an bhainisteoir? May I speak to the manager?
An dtig liom ... a fheiceáil? May I see ...?
An dtig liom an dochtúir a fheiceáil? May I see the doctor?

Again you can say Thig or Ní thig in answer to these questions.
