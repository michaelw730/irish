ASKING SOMEONE WHERE THEY ARE FROM

|Irish|English|Phonetic|Sound|Info|
|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|Cá as tú?|Where are you from?|||After giving your response, you can ask the same question in the following ways:
|Cá as túsa?|Where are *you* from?  or
|Cá as tú féin?|Where are you from yourself?
|Is as ... mé. |I'm from ...
|Is as Dún Geanainn mé. |I'm from Dungannon.
|As Léim an Mhadaidh.|From Limavady.

This is generally used as a statement or as a response to a general question such as 'Tell me a little about yourself.' However, when answering a more specific question, such as Cá as tú? people tend to say As and the name of the place.


ASKING SOMEONE WHERE THEY LIVE

|Irish|English|Phonetic|Sound|Info|
|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|Cá bhfuil tú i do chónaí?|Where do you live?
|Tá mé i mo chónaí i(n)... |I live in...
|Tá mé i mo chónaí in Aontroim. |I live in Antrim.
|Tá mé i mo chónaí i nDún Geanainn. |I live in Dungannon.

If you are responding to the question Cá bhfuil tú i do chónaí? you can just say, I(n) and the name of the place.

The following sentence will prove useful to you if you don't live in the place you are originally from.

|------|-------|--------|-----|----|
|As Ard Mhacha ó dhúchas mé, ach tá mé i mo chónaí i mBeal Feirste anois.|I'm originally from Armagh, but I live in Belfast now.

* I is used before words beginning with a consonant, and causes an urú:
    * i dTír Eoghain
    * i nDún Dealgan
* If the word begins with a vowel, in is used instead:
    * in Achadh na Chloiche
    * in Ard Mhacha
