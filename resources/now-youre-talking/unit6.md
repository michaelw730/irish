Information Text from the Workbook
ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY WANT
Cad é ba mhaith leat? What would you like?
Cad é ba mhaith leatsa? What would you like?
Cad é ba mhaith libh? What would you like? (when speaking to more than one person)

You can use the following when addressing a friend or family member:
Cad é atá de dhíth ort? What do you want?
Cad é atá de dhíth oraibh? What do you want? (when speaking to more than one person)
SAYING WHAT YOU WANT
Ba mhaith liom ... I'd like ...
Ba mhaith liom cupa tae. I'd like a cup of tea.

When responding to the question Cad é ba mhaith leat? you can drop Ba mhaith liom and simply say the name of the thing you want.

If you're in company and the question Cad é ba mhaith libh? is being addressed to the group as a whole, than you can use domhsa and liomsa to answer specifically for yourself:
Caife dubh domhsa. A black coffee for me.
Ba mhaith liomsa tae le bainne. I'd like tea with milk.

trí chaife
cúig phionta
sé ghloine

The numbers 7-10 cause an urú in words beginning with a consonant (except l, m, n, r, and s) and in all words beginning with a vowel:
seacht mbuidéal
ocht bpionta
naoi ngloine
deich bpionta
but

TELLING SOMEONE THAT A DRINK IS THEIRS
... duitse. ... for you.
Pionta beorach duitse. A pint of beer for you.
Seo do ... Here's your ...
Seo do phionta Here's your pint.
TRADITIONAL TOASTS
Sláinte mhaith agat i bhfad ó bhrón.
Good health, free from sorrow.
Sláinte do bheo agus tróicaire do mharbh.
Health to the living and mercy on the dead.
Go mba fada a mhairfidh tú.
Long life to you
The word duitse means 'for you' or 'to you' and is made up of the following:
do (for / to) + tú (you) + se (which is used to add emphasis to tú).

Earlier we saw the word domhsa, which means 'for me' or 'to me' and is a combination of the following elements:
do (for / to) + mé (me) + sa (which is used to add emphasis to mé).
