# Episode 1

## Introduction

Hello and welcome, or as we say in Irish - `Fáilte` - I'm Deirbhile and I'll be here throughout the series which is aimed at helping you speak Irish.  Accents and dialects differ slightly throughout the country.  In this series we'll concentrate on Ulster Irish but in later programmes we'll keep you in touch with what's used elsewhere.

After today's programme, you should be able to introduce yourself and comment on such important topics as the weather.  So now's your chance to start from scratch or to refresh what you once knew.

The programmes themselves will help you cope will all kinds of different situations and there is plenty of backup material.  I'll tell you about that later on. Oh and by the way, you're never to old to learn!

## Marketplace

We're starting off here at the marketplace.  Well first thing's first, how do we greet somebody - How are you?  `Cad é mar atá tú?`

### Conversation 1-5

`Cad é mar atá tú?`

Listen again [repeat Conversation 1-5]

`Cad é mar atá tú?`  How are you?

### Conversation 6

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`

You probably noticed in the last instance that the question was `Cad é mar atá sibh?`. This is what you use when you greet more than one person.  Let's watch more examples  where more than one person is greeted.  Listen carefully - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`.

### Conversation 7-9

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`  How are you?  [when speaking to more than one person]


So, it's `Cad e mar atá tú?` when greeting one person and `Cad é mar atá sibh?`, if you can get their attention, when greeting more than one person.  Let's watch these situations again and this time, try to figure out in advance whether it should be `Cad é mar atá tú?` or `Cad é mar atá sibh?`.

* Conversation 10 - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
* Conversation 11 - `Cad é mar atá tú?`
* Conversation 12 - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
* Conversation 13 - `Cad é mar atá tú?`

`Cad é mar atá tú?`  How are you?

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`  How are you?  [when speaking to more than one person]


So, it's `Cad é mar atá tú?` when greeting one person and `Cad é mar atá sibh?` when greeting more than one person and of course and if somebody asks you how you are, you need to have a reply.  Generally people are too polite to say how they really feel.  They'll either say `Go maith`, fine, or `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`, fine, thank you.

* Conversation 14 
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith`
* Conversation 15 
  * `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
    * `Go maith`

`Go maith` - Fine

* Conversation 16
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`
  
* Conversation 17
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`
* Conversation 18
  * `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`
* Conversation 19
  * `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
    * `Go maith`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`

`Go maith, go raibh maith agat` - Fine, thank you.

The word 'bally' comes form the Irish word `Baile` and is commonly found in place names all over this island.  `Baile` means a place where people live - home or a town and 'Now you're talking' we have our own town `An baile Mór`, Ballymore, where our hero and heroine, Séan and Deirdre, first meet.

## Conversation 20

D: `Capricorn - lucky day Tuesday, today the cavalry rides in.  But be careful, it may take more than it leaves.`

## Conversation 21

S: `Cad é mar atá tú?`

D: `Go maith.`
D: `Go raibh maith agat`

D: `Oh, hallo a mhamaí.`
M: `Oh, hallo a Dheirdre. Cad é mar atá tú?  Deirdre...`


D: `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`

D: `OK, Slán a mhamaí... Slán!`



`Go maith` fine or `Go maith, go raibh maith agat` - Fine, thank you.

Repeat Conversation 21

Now let's go back again to a situation we saw earlier and listen to the responses and to another useful new phrase `agus, tú féin?`, and yourself.

* Conversation 22
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat.  Agus tú féin?`
      * `Go maith`

* Conversation 23
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith.  Agus tú féin?`
      * `Go maith`

* Conversation 24
  * `Cad é mar atá síbh?`
    * `Ah, go maith.  Agus tú féin?`
      * `Go maith`

Repeat Conversation 22-24

Throughout the series of 'Now you're talking' we'll look at how the language and culture is woven into our lives.  Let's begin with placenames.

The Irish imagination was never lacking and many place names where inspired by parts of the human body.

Belfast, which you see here behind me, is a good one to start with.  Belfast is derived from Beal Feirste.  Beal meaning mouth and fearset meaning tidal crossing. Beal Feirste, the mouth of the tidal crossing.  Other body parts were also borrowed and appear in many place names.  Gola - shoulder, cos - foot, ceann - head, drim - back, and toin - backside.  No part of the body was sacred.

Guala Dhudh: Gulladuff - Co. Derry.  Black Shoulder
Cois Abhann Dalla: Cushendall - Co. Antrim.  Foot of the River Dall
Ceann Mara: Kenmare - Co. Kerry.  Head of the sea
Droim Conrach: Drumcondra - Co. Dublin.  Ridge of the path
Tóin re Gaoith: Tandragee - Co. Armagh.  Backside to the wind

Belfast was active in the early revivals of the Irish Language and Culture.  And it was in this very building, then the Belfast exchange hall, that a unique and historical event took place.  Some Belfast citizens organised the harpers gathering of 1792.  It was an attempt to preserve the music, poetry and oral traditions of the country.  The harpers, 10 in number, including 97 year old Dennis Hempsin (?), gave it their best, and their music was transcribed by Edward Bunting.  Some of the Ayres are very well known to use today, such as the Coolin. 

Unfortunately, Bunting's counterpart, who was supposed to record the words, never turned up.  Subsequently, Thomas Moore wrote lyrics for many of the Ayres and it's with those lyrics that the Ayres are identified today.

Let's do a quick recap on what we've learned so far.

* Conversation 25
  * `Cad é mar atá tu?`
    * `Go maith.  Agus tú féin?`
      * `Ah, go maith`

* Conversation 26
  * `Enya, Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Mairead, Go maith, go raibh maith agat.`

`Cad é mar atá tú?`.  Another thing we tend to do when we meet somebody is comment on the weather.  If it's a fine day, we say `Tá lá breá ann`.  Another unfortunately popular one is `Tá drochlá ann` - it's a bad day.  The answer to either greeting is invariably, `Tá`, it is, nobody ever disagrees.  

* Conversation 27
  * `Cad é mar atá tú, Fiona?`
    * `Tá mé go maith.  Cad é mar atá tú féin?`
      * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat.  Tá lá breá ann.`

* Conversation 28
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat.`
      * `Tá lá breá ann.`


* Conversation 29
  * `Tá drochlá ann` 
* Conversation 30
  * `Ah, tá drochlá ann` 

`Tá drochlá ann` - it's a bad day. [repeat Irish]
`Tá lá breá ann` - it's a fine day. [repeat Irish]

Your turn now.  YOu decide how to describe the weather you'll be seeing in the next few scenes.  Either `Tá lá breá ann` or `Tá drochlá ann`.

* `Tá drochlá ann`
* Repeat Conversation 27
* Repeat Conversation 29 
* Repeat Conversation 28
* Repeat Conversation 30

* Conversation 31
  * `Tá drochlá ann` 
    * `Tá sé fuar`
      * `Tá, cinnte`


* Conversation 32
  * `Tá sé fuar`
    * `Tá, cinnte`


`Tá sé fuar`.  And before I get too cold, did you notice how some of the people who exchanged comments on the weather added a few extra words.  `Tá, cinnte` - it is surely.  `Tá sé fuar, cinnte` - it's cold, surely.  Have another look.

* Repeat conversation 32
* Repeat conversation 31

Here are some more examples of those most important words when referring to the weather.  `Té` - hot, and `fuar` - cold.

* Conversation 33
  * `Tá sé fuar, innui`
    * `Tá sé fuar`


* Conversation 34
  * `Tá lá breá ann`
    * `Tá sé té`
      * `Tá, cinnte`

* Conversation 35
  * `Tá drochlá ann.  Tá sé fuar`
    * `Tá, cinnte`
  
* Conversation 36
  * `Hew, Tá sé té`

* Conversation 37
  * `Tá jacuzzi té`

* Conversation 38
  * `Tá drochlá ann.  Tá sé fliuch.`

* Conversation 39
  * `Tá sé fliuch.`
* Conversation 40
  * `Tá drochlá ann.`
    * `Tá sé fuar agus fliuch.`


`Tá sé té` - it's warm or hot.  [repeat irish]
`Tá sé fuar` - it's cold  [repeat irish]
`Tá sé fliuch` - it's wet  [repeat irish]

And, when the weater is fine, which isn't often enough, we usually thank God. `Buíochas le Dia`.


* Conversation 41
  * `Cad é mar atá tú?`
    * `Go maith, go raibh maith agat.`
      * `Tá lá breá ann.`
        * `Tá, buíochas le Dia`
          * `cluiche fichille`?? Game of Chess??
            * `Tá cinnte`
