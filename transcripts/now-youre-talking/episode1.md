# Episode 1

## Introduction

Hello and welcome, or as we say in Irish - `Fáilte` - I'm Deirbhile and I'll be here throughout the series which is aimed at helping you speak Irish.  Accents and dialects differ slightly throughout the country.  In this series we'll concentrate on Ulster Irish but in later programmes we'll keep you in touch with what's used elsewhere.

After today's programme, you should be able to introduce yourself and comment on such important topics as the weather.  So now's your chance to start from scratch or to refresh what you once knew.

The programmes themselves will help you cope will all kinds of different situations and there is plenty of backup material.  I'll tell you about that later on. Oh and by the way, you're never to old to learn.

## Marketplace

We're starting off here at the marketplace.  Well first thing's first, how do we greet somebody - How are you?  `Cad é mar atá tú?`

### Conversation 1-5

`Cad é mar atá tú?`

Listen again [repeat Conversation 1-5]

`Cad é mar atá tú?`  How are you?

### Conversation 6

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`

You probably noticed in the last instance that the question was `Cad é mar atá sibh?`. This is what you use when you greet more than one person.  Let's watch more example where more than one person is greeted.  Listen carefully - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`.

### Conversation 7-9

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`  How are you?  [when speaking to more than one person]


So it's `Cad e mar atá tú?` when greeting one person and `Cad é mar atá sibh?`, if you can get their attention, when greeting more than one person.  Let's watch these situations again and this time, try to figure out in advance whether it should be `Cad é mar atá tú?` or `Cad é mar atá sibh?`.

* Conversation 10 - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
* Conversation 11 - `Cad é mar atá tú?`
* Conversation 12 - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`
* Conversation 13 - `Cad é mar atá tú?`

`Cad é mar atá tú?`  How are you?

`Cad é mar atá sibh?`  How are you?  [when speaking to more than one person]


So, it's `Cad é mar atá tú?` when greeting one person and `Cad é mar atá sibh?` when greeting more than one person and of course and if somebody asks you how you are, you need to have a reply.  Generally people are too polite to say how they really feel.  They'll either say `Go maith`, fine, or `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`, fine, thank you.
